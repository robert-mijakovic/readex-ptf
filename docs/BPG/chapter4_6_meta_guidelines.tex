\begin{itemize}
	\item In which case one should use fixed sequence and when one should go for adaptive sequence plugin?
	\item Which plugins are most suitable to use in the combination?
	\item Is ordering of the plugin execution plays role? If yes, how one can decide the order?
	Ordering of the plugin execution does not matter as they are executed sequentially. 
	
	\item Possible search strategies, and their significance.
	Meta-plugins do not have any search strategies. Search strategy of the plugins executed by the meta-plugin is used.
