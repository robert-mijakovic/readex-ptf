The Periscope Tuning Framework (PTF) is an extension to the existing performance analysis tool Periscope. PTF makes it possible to use profiling information gathered by Periscope and employ it for automatically tuning software applications. 

There are five tuning plugins available as part of PTF, which target different tuning problems/techniques and which can be used to improve the performance and energy efficiency of a given application with one or more tuning techniques.

PTF and its associated tuning plugins provide many features to aid users in their effective exploitation. It is therefore useful to understand these features and techniques so as to be able to extract maximum benefit out of PTF. 

This Best Practice Guide provides various ways to use each plugin more effectively as well as obtain tuning results more efficiently. In Section 2 of this guide, we explain how PTF fits into the overall tuning lifecycle. In Section 3, we provide several generic best practices applicable for all the plugins as well as the steps required for manual instrumentation. Finally, in Section 4, best practices specific to each of the separate plugins are provided.
